## Linked Lists

- Linked lists are comprised of **nodes**
  - either nodes or null, nothing else
- Treated sequentially but the nodes inhabit different spaces in memory, not contiguous
- Super good at swapping stuff out from the beginning
  - Beginning is represented by the **head**
- You'll see these a lot in applications that need to take up very low memory (aerospace, small devices, etc)
- Questions we can ask a linked list:
  - Is this the head or current node?
- Questions we can ask a node:
  - What do you contain?
  - Is there a next node?
