## OAuth cont.

1. Write the following steps in the correct order:

- Register your application to get a client_id and client_secret
- Ask the client if they want to sign in via a third party
- Make a request to the access token endpoint
- Receive access token
- Make a request to a third-party API endpoint
- Redirect to a third party authentication endpoint
- Receive authorization code

2. What can you do with an authorization code?

With the authorization code the application/client can make a request to the access token endpoint.

3. What can you do with an access token?

With an access token you can make the request to the third-party API endpoint in order to get the protected resource.
- Exchange information between two bodies
- Self contained with information about the user
- Avoid querying the db more than once, you just pass the token each time and jwt system verifies it

4. Whatâ€™s a benefit of using OAuth instead of your own basic authentication?

If you're using OAuth you don't have to store the user's unique information in a database somewhere.
