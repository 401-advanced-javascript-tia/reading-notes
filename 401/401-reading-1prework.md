### Solving Problems
https://simpleprogrammer.com/solving-problems-breaking-it-down/

- Spend the time upfront to plan your approach to solving the problem
  - Understand the problem
- Keep it as simple as possible
- Suggested steps:
  - !! **Read the problem in whole, twice** !!
    - could you explain it to someone else?
  - **Solve it manually with 3 sets sample data**
    - recognize what your brain is doing to solve it manually
  - **Optimize manual steps**
    - is there an easier way to solve the problem?
  - **Write manual steps as comments**
  - **Replace comments with real code**
    - should not involve any problem solving at this point
    - if struggling, problem wasnt broken down enough in previous steps
  - **Optimize real code**
    - take a look and see if there's an easier way
    - good variable names
  - *Plan to spend about 70% of time in first 3 steps!*
  - If problem is big and complex, cut in half and do the above for each half! **divide and conquer!**

  - In any language, you should know how to do the following in order to approach these problems:
    - create a list
    - sort a list or array
    - create a map or dictionary
    - loop through a list, or dictionary
    - parse strings
    - convert from string to int, int to string, etc

- Your time is so valuable, why spend it on dumb stuff like being angry or scrolling social media! 
- **Busymess isn't a badge of honor, it's a sign of weakness**
- Be *focused*, not *busy*
- Do what you do with complete and hard focus... **deep work**
- If you know how valuable your time is, people will see and respect that as well
- Say no, weed out the "good" to make room for the "great"


### How To Think Like a Programmer
https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-think-like-a-programmer-lessons-in-problem-solving-d1d8bf1de7d2/

- **A more effective way for problem solving**
- Don't get caught up in the syntax of everything, focus on how to solve the problem

1. Understand the problem. Explain it out loud, listen to yourself. Write it down. Sketch it. Whatever you need to better understand.
2. Plan the solution and write notes in the comments. 
3. Divide the problem into easier-to-manage pieces, sub-problems. Solve all the sub problems and connect the dots. 
4. Stuck? Debug, reassess, research. 

- Struggling means learning
- Practice and do brain teasers and games to keep sharp!

### 5 Whys and 5 Hows
https://www.mindtools.com/pages/article/newTMC_5W.htm

- When a problem occurs, get down to the root cause by asking 'why' 5 times
- "Solution" = "counter-measure"
  - action seeks to prevent the problem from happening again (vs a solution that deals with a symptom of the problem)
  - designed to prevent the problem from recurring
- Suggested way to use 5 Whys Analysis:
  - Gather a team familiar with problem, designate a facilitator
  - Define the problem
  - Ask first why, accept answers grounded in fact (not guessing)
  - Four more whys
  - Know when to stop and when an appropriate counter-measure is possible
  - Address the root cause by discussing and agreeing on a counter-measure
  - Monitor the measure to see if its preventing root cause from recurring
