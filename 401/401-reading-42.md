## Ethics

**Ethics in the Workplace**
- One of the articles I read was about the stand Microsoft employees took against their company's participation in this administration's horrific border policies. Love to see it! I think (hope) that this is something more and more important to job-seekers as they choose a company to work for. It's increasingly important for us to see big companies taking a stand and aligning their work on the right side of history. This is absolutely something that is important to me in finding a place to work, and in front-loading the due diligence I hope to never find myself in a position where I'm asked to do work that goes against my morals and ethics. But I understand this happens and that I may find myself in a position similar to the guy in the 'code I'm still ashamed of' article, and that it's important to be prepared for the reprecussions that may come from taking a stand in what you believe in. 

**Ethics in Technology**
- The article (linked below) that discussed the ethics of self driving cars was very interesting and it seems like it's going to come down to the choices in technology and how each individual creator of that technology has prioritized ethical decisions. One company's tech might save the child while another company's tech would save the pedestrians. Will that be a choice people make when purchasing (hiring) self-driving cars, they'll be choosing a company that they know has tech that aligns with their ethics? Will people think that much into it? Probably not, as with most other ethical choices that we have and mostly choose to ignore (where we buy our clothes, our food, etc). I am for sure wary of self-driving cars because it feels like another thing big tech is trying to push on the people before it's ethical implications have been fully processed.
