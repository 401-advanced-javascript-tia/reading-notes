- OAuth: When you log into a website using another websites login credentials

1. Why is authentication important?
- Authentication is super important because it's the way we can identify unique users and keep their unique, sensitive data secure. 

2. Why should we be careful about storing a userâ€™s password?
- We should be careful about storing a user's password because as the developer, it's our responsiblity to make sure it's kept secure. 

3. What is the difference between hashing and encryption?
- Encryption is a two-way function in that something can be decrypted with the use of the key, whereas hashing is one-way. With a good process there's no way to reverse the hashing to get to the original text. 

4. What is the difference between encryption and encoding?
- Encoding is a process that reverses the algorith that encoded the thing in the first place, whereas encryption requires the use of a key to get it back to plain text.

5. What is a token used for?
- The token acts like a ticket to the fair, you need it to get through and do what you want to do.
