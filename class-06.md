### Online article 
#### Understanding the Problem Domain is the Hardest Part of Programming
- **Understanding the problem is the most critical piece to the equation!**
- Take the time to do this
- Why make life harder by trying to solve a problem before you know the question?

### Ch 3 - Object Literals (p 100-105)
- *Objects* group together set of variable and functions, they take on new names
- **Objects organize related material**
  - *Variables* become *properties*
  - *Functions* become *methods*
  - *Keys* and *values* pairs
- Use literal notation
  - HOW TO PUT CODE EXAMPLE IN HERE?
- **Access the object** with dot notations
  - PUT AN EXAMPLE IN HERE
- **Only way to make dynamic is with access notations, not dot notation**


### Ch 5 - Document Object Model (p 183-242)
- 

- choosing key value pairs is the data driven part of domain modeling
- visual part involves actually putting html on the page


Domain Modeling
- organization of data
- best way to built the website to show the organization

- go through and hard code it, make it how you want it to look like before you mess with it

- **DOM Manipulation**
1. Finding the target (a place to put a new html elemnt)
- for ex: make empty ul tag with an id to be able to find it
- then in html can use document.getElementById
2. Generating a new element(for example, a new p tag to live on the page)
- can use document.createElement
2. Give that element content (for a p tag - text, or for an image a source)
- can use .textContent
3. Put it on the page (append)
- can use .appendChild
- **Make sure you end up calling the function to get it all to renderToPage**
- .this means *the object we are currently in*
