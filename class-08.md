- Design needs to be able to work on range of different sized screens
- *Positioning schemes* (pg 363) allows you to control flow of page
  - *Box offset* properties (pg 364)
- *Float* property moves stuff to left or right of page, can be used to create multi-column layouts
  - Floated things require defined width
- Pages can be fixed width or liquid (stretchy) 
  - Important advantages and disadvantages for each (pg 381)
- Popular design theory
  - Keep pages within 960-1000 pixels wide
