### Ch 15 - Layout (p 358-404, focus on 358-364, look at code sample on website)
- *Block level elements* like h1, p, ul, li

#### Positioning Schemes
- *Normal flow*
  - each block level is on new line, like normal
- *Relative positioning*

  - move as users scroll up and down page 

#### Box Offset Properties
- Tells browser how far from top, bottom, left, or right it should be placed
- *Fixed positioning*
  - positions element in relation to browser window, as opposed to containing element
