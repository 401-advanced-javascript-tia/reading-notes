https://gist.github.com/brookr/5977550
- **HTTP** is like *"GPS coordinates for knowledge and information"*
- **URLs** are *nouns*
- Verbs on the nouns (get, put, delete)
- HTTP is all about applying verbs to nouns
- REST is the architectural style the web is built on

*Requested API keys from the following:*
