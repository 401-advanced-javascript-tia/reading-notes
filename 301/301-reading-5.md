### Heroku Deployment
https://howtonode.org/deploy-blog-to-heroku

- Heroku pretty much just lets us deploy servers (much like GitHub Pages but Pages doesnt really allow for servers)
- Run by same peeps who did AWS

- **DIRT**: Data-Intensive Real-Time applications
- Node allows you to create an app that responds instantly to large num of users

- NODE IS JUST AN ENVIRONMENT THAT ALLOWS US TO WRITE JAVASCRIPT IN THE BACKEND
- Package.json is the manifesto for your file setup
  - holds all of the information for your application (name, repo, info about how to turn app on, tests, etc)
  - npm init
    - node package manager

- servers are really good at keeping secrets
