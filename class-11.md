## **Duckett HTML & CSS**

### Ch 16 - Images (p 406-427)
- Specify img dimensions in CSS
  - This actually helps pages load better because code often loads before images, telling browser how much space to leave for img so it can move on and render the rest of the page (interesting!)
  - Give images classes in HTML, small medium large etc
    - Side note: you can put multiple classes on things
- Aligning images
  - Can use classes here too for align-left and align-right, to set float properties in CSS
- Using images as backgrounds
  - Can set on whole body or on certain boxes
  - Different repeating properties
  - Shorthand order, ok to miss certain things but must be in this order:
    - background-color
    - background-image
    - background-repeat
    - background-attachment
    - background-position
- Image rollover effects
- *Image sprites* can be used to reduce number of images your browser has to load
  - pg 417, this is really interesting!
